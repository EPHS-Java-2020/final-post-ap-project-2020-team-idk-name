# Volcanic Panic
Welcome to Volcanic Panic, a survival game where the goal is to not die! (shocker!)
The controls are simple, press space to start the game, and use arrow keys to move, jump and crouch. You get 3 lives, and you lose lives if you hit the meteors falling from the sky or the fireballs coming in from the side. If you hit a toxic drink, you become slow for 5 seconds. And those are the rules!
